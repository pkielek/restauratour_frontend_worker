## Thesis Abstract

Modern world has presented catering industry with many challenges. In this competitive market, reaching the widest possible customer base is crucial. Customers in turn are becoming increasingly demanding, requiring support for the work of waiters so they can focus on delivering excellent service. These issues can be addressed through the implementation of an appropriate information system, ensuring convenience for both customers and restaurant staff. This engineering thesis aims to create such a system. Its main idea is to connect the interaction between the restaurant owner, employees, and customers through three dedicated applications for each group. The owner, after adjusting the layout of tables and the restaurant menu, has the ability to create accounts for waiters who can, in real-time, manage complex orders, serve customers, and handle their reservations. On the other hand, customers have the opportunity to explore the database of restaurants participating in the information system, view the restaurant layout, and reserve a table of their choice. Upon reservation acceptance, the customer can place an order both before and during their visit. The customer also has the option to summon a waiter using the application, reflecting in their app. Creation of such a system is enabled by Flutter technology, which provides the ability to deploy applications on multiple platforms using a single codebase or using a shared fragments of code. This implementation addresses the challenges posed and ensures convenience during the restaurant visit process.
